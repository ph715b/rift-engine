/**
 * Card implementations for **Mind** — one file, one owner.
 *
 * This file exists so that work on the card pool can be split up without two
 * people (or two agents) ever editing the same file. The ownership rule is
 * mechanical, not a convention: a defId may only appear here if its
 * CardDefinition has exactly one domain and that domain is Mind. A test in
 * test/effect-registry.test.ts enforces it, so a card filed in the wrong place
 * fails the suite rather than being merged and forgotten.
 *
 * Cards with TWO domains (the champion signature spells) belong in
 * effects/signature.ts, and Legends in engine/legend-abilities.ts — every Legend
 * is dual-domain by definition, so splitting those by domain is meaningless.
 *
 * To add a card:
 *   1. Register it under its defId in `cardEffects` (Spell/Gear) or
 *      `unitTriggers` (Unit's on-play ability), matching the shapes in
 *      card-effects.ts / unit-triggers.ts.
 *   2. Cite the rule or the oracle implementation the behaviour comes from —
 *      "mirrors <the Java oracle>" is not a rules citation, see
 *      docs/rules-conformance.md on why this project distinguishes them.
 *   3. Add an engine test. A silently-inert card is indistinguishable from a
 *      working one in play, which is exactly how the current gap went unnoticed.
 *
 * Composition rejects duplicates, so registering a defId that some other file
 * already handles throws at import rather than silently shadowing it.

    // scope: "anywhere", deliberately. The card says "a unit", NOT "a unit at a
    // battlefield", and rule 355.9.b settles what the bare noun means: the
    // targeting section's own list of Public zones names Bases alongside
    // Battlefield Zones, so a unit standing at home is a legal target. No owner
    // restriction is printed either, so `owner` is left unset — shrinking your
    // own unit is a bad play, not an illegal one. Same reading Orb of Regret,
    // Stupefy and Discipline already got; base is not a safe parking spot.
    //
    // The floor is the card's own "to a minimum of 1 Might" clause, and
    // giveMightThisTurn's `floor` argument exists for exactly this wording: it
    // caps the STORED modifier rather than only the displayed Might, so a
    // second Smoke Screen on an already-floored unit takes nothing further off
    // instead of digging a hole a later pump would have to climb out of. Buffs
    // and continuous auras are deliberately not counted towards the floor —
    // they can appear and vanish after this resolves, and the minimum is fixed
    // at resolution time. That simplification lives in the helper, not here.
    //
    // giveMightThisTurn, NOT a Buff. This expires in the Expiration Step ("all
    // 'this turn' effects expire simultaneously", rule 317), which
    // turn-manager.ts's runEnd gets for free by zeroing every unit's
    // mightThisTurn; a Buff (rule 710) is a persistent game object that would
    // survive the turn and only come off when the unit leaves play (rule 709).
    // A negative Buff isn't a thing in the first place.
    //
    // [Reaction] is rule 813 and is NOT implemented here — engine/timing.ts
    // owns when this may be played, including onto an already-open chain. The
    // resolver is identical whenever it runs, so there is nothing
    // timing-shaped for this entry to do.
