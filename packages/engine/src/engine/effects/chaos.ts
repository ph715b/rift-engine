/**
 * Card implementations for **Chaos** — one file, one owner.
 *
 * This file exists so that work on the card pool can be split up without two
 * people (or two agents) ever editing the same file. The ownership rule is
 * mechanical, not a convention: a defId may only appear here if its
 * CardDefinition has exactly one domain and that domain is Chaos. A test in
 * test/effect-registry.test.ts enforces it, so a card filed in the wrong place
 * fails the suite rather than being merged and forgotten.
 *
 * Cards with TWO domains (the champion signature spells) belong in
 * effects/signature.ts, and Legends in engine/legend-abilities.ts — every Legend
 * is dual-domain by definition, so splitting those by domain is meaningless.
 *
 * To add a card:
 *   1. Register it under its defId in `cardEffects` (Spell/Gear) or
 *      `unitTriggers` (Unit's on-play ability), matching the shapes in
 *      card-effects.ts / unit-triggers.ts.
 *   2. Cite the rule or the oracle implementation the behaviour comes from —
 *      "mirrors <the Java oracle>" is not a rules citation, see
 *      docs/rules-conformance.md on why this project distinguishes them.
 *   3. Add an engine test. A silently-inert card is indistinguishable from a
 *      working one in play, which is exactly how the current gap went unnoticed.
 *
 * Composition rejects duplicates, so registering a defId that some other file
 * already handles throws at import rather than silently shadowing it.
