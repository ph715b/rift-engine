/**
 * Which cards actually DO something, and which only look like they do.
 *
 * This exists because a card whose printed text has no implementation is
 * indistinguishable from a working one during a game: it costs runes, goes to the
 * trash, and quietly changes nothing. That is how most of a deck can be inert
 * without anyone noticing — measured at the time of writing, 211 of the 255
 * OGN+OGS cards carrying real rules text had no implementation, and three of the
 * seven preset decks were majority-inert.
 *
 * The measurement has to be trustworthy in BOTH directions. Under-reporting
 * hides inert cards from a playtest; over-reporting greys out cards that work and
 * invites re-implementing them. registeredDefIds below asks every implementing
 * module rather than a curated list, and test/coverage-drift.test.ts enforces
 * that by scanning the source.
 *
 * The point of surfacing it is honesty about scope, the same reason
 * docs/rules-conformance.md distinguishes "Conformant" from "Unverified": a deck
 * builder that shows which cards are implemented lets you draw correct
 * conclusions from a playtest. One that doesn't invites wrong ones.

 * Keywords the rules engine does NOT implement, each with what is missing.

 * rather than in an effect registry. That assumption is load-bearing — it is what
 * keeps a vanilla-with-a-keyword card from reporting inert — but it was
 * ASSUMED rather than checked, and it is false for exactly one of the thirteen
 * entries in KEYWORDS.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-01 by asking, per keyword, which engine modules consult it:
 * twelve have a real consumer (combat.ts, timing.ts, hidden.ts, legal-actions.ts,
 * effective-might.ts…). `[Deflect]`'s only two mentions are the table that GRANTS
 * it and a doc comment in rune-payment.ts recording that the surcharge is absent.
 * Nothing reads it, so a spell targeting a Deflect unit pays the printed price.
 *
 * The cost of leaving that unstated was a measure that lied in the direction this
 * module's own doc comment calls the worse one. Pouty Poro's entire printed text
 * is `[Deflect]`, so the strip left nothing, `needsImplementation` said no, and it
 * reported as implemented while doing nothing — in a precon deck, twice.
 * Fiora - Victorious granted it and reported finished on the strength of the two
 * keywords that do work.
 *
 * Listing it here rather than fixing those two cards by hand is the point: the
 * next unimplemented keyword ([Backline]/[Hunt]/[Level]/[Ambush] are already
 * named in KEYWORDS' own doc comment as pending sets) cannot silently reopen the
 * same hole, and when Deflect lands, DELETING one entry flips all seven cards
 * that carry it at once.
